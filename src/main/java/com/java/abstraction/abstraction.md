General Definition
Abstraction is **commonly defined** as the extraction of
relevant information from a larger data set,
where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase.

However, in computer science, 
abstraction typically means simplification 
and separating the signal from the noise
in order to make programming more efficient and effective.

Abstraction means simplification of process of how one class/system will interact with
another class/system .

It can be done by hiding the complex/unnecessary details 
and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts.
It allows you to focus on what object can do rathar than how it does it.
It promotes the cleaner and maintainable design.


**Abstraction  simplifies how information is represented in external systems**
by hiding complex details and exposing only the essential features.
This makes the codebase more versatile(having more variety), 
easier to maintain, and more intuitive to use


Types of Data Abstraction

Data Abstraction : 
Therefore, data abstraction refers to hiding the original data entity 
via a data structure that can internally work through the hidden data entities. 
As programmers, we donâ€™t need to know what the underlying entity is,
how it looks etc.
For example ArrayList uses Array internally but it never exposes that DS to us help in abstraction and encapsulation

Abstraction is a design-level process, 
but encapsulation is an implementation process. 
Encapsulation tells us how exactly you can implement abstraction in the program. 
Abstraction pertains to only displaying the essential details to the user
whereas encapsulation pertains to typing up all the data members
and associated member functions into a single abstracted unit.
