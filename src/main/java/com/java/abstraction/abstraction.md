Abstraction is commonly defined as the extraction of
relevant information from a larger data set,
where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase.

**Abstraction is simply the process of making codebase
information more versatile by simplifying
how it's represented in external systems .**

Abstraction in programming simplifies how information is represented in external systems by hiding complex details and exposing only the essential features.
This makes the codebase more versatile, easier to maintain, and more intuitive to use

abstraction typically means simplification and separating
the signal from the noise
in order to make programming more efficient and effective.
