When you design a class, think about the objects that
will be created from that class type. Think about:

**1.things the object knows
2.things the object does**

Things an object knows about itself are called instance
variables. They represent an object’s state (the data) and can
have unique values for each object of that type.
Think of instance as another way of saying object.
Things an object can do are called methods. When you
design a class, you think about the data an object will need to
know about itself, and you also design the methods that operate
on that data.

Object-oriented programming lets you extend
a program without having to touch previously
tested, working code.
All	Java	code	is	defined	in	a	class

An object can take care of itself; you don’t
have to know or care how the object does it.
1. An object knows things and does things.
2. Things an object knows about itself are called
instance variables. They represent the state
of an object.
3. Things an object does are called methods.
They represent the behavior of an object.
4. A class can inherit instance variables and
   methods from a more abstract superclass.
5. At runtime, a Java program is nothing more
   than objects “talking” to other objects.
